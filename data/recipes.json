Line a baking sheet with foil. Alternatively, you can set it to 500 degrees on the broil setting for medium rare with a yummy crispy top – the risk here is that you have to watch closely so it doesn’t burn the sugar. If taking this route, make sure one of the oven racks is close-ish to the top, about 6 inches or so.\nSalmon\nMix the spices and the olive oil to make a paste. Place the salmon skin side down on the baking sheet. Rub the paste liberally over the top part of the salmon. Bake for 6-12 minutes depending on the thickness of your salmon and your desired doneness. See notes if you’re not sure.\nBowl it up\nPile up some rice, pull off some of salmon, and spoon that mango avocado salsa over the whole thing. Add a lime squeezer for good measure. IT’S SO GOOD.",

    "total_time": 120,
    "yields": "8 servings",
    "ingredients": [
      "200g plain flour plus extra for dusting",
      "50g walnuts (shelled weight)",
      "50g cold butter chopped into small pieces",
      "25g vegetarian hard cheese (or Parmesan if you’re not making a strictly vegetarian version), grated",
      "1 medium egg beaten",
      "1 tbsp olive oil",
      "6 shallots sliced",
      "3 large garlic cloves finely chopped",

      "1 punnet cress",
      "zest 1 lemon plus extra to serve"

    "instructions": "To make the pastry, whizz the flour and walnuts in a food processor until the walnuts are very fine. Add the butter and cheese and whizz again until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the beaten egg and 1 tsp cold water. Pulse until the mixture forms a dough, adding a little more water if needed. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins.\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to the thickness of a 50p piece and use it to line a 23cm tart tin. Prick the base several times with a fork and return to the fridge to chill for a further 15 mins. (Don’t be tempted to skip this step – it will help prevent any shrinkage.)\nHeat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the shallots and garlic. Fry for 5-10 mins until the shallots have softened and are golden. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.\nLine your pastry with baking parchment, fill with baking beans and bake for 15 mins. Remove the parchment and return to the oven for a further 10 mins – this will allow the base to dry out before you add the filling. Reduce oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3.\nCrack the egg into a medium-sized mixing bowl and add the yolks. Beat lightly with a fork before pouring in the cream. Stir in the shallots and garlic, as well as three-quarters of the Talegio, three-quarters of the cress and the lemon zest. Season.\nPour the mixture into the tart case, add the remaining cheese and season with pepper.\nBake for 40-50 mins until the filling is set and feels firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 mins. Scatter over the remaining cress and lemon zest.",

Check if it’s cooked by poking the tip of a sharp knife into the thickest part; there should be no sign of pink and juices will run clear.\nBash 1 garlic clove with the flat of a knife and peel off the skin. Crush with a garlic crusher. Mash 2 anchovies with a fork against the side of a small bowl.\nGrate a handful of parmesan cheese and mix with the garlic, anchovies, 5 tbsp Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise and 1 tbsp white wine vinegar. Season to taste. It should be the consistency of yogurt – if yours is thicker, stir in a few tsps water to thin it.\nShave the cheese with a peeler. Tear 1 large cos or romaine lettuce into large pieces and put in a large bowl. Pull chicken into bite-size strips and scatter half over the leaves, along with half the croutons.\nAdd most of the dressing and toss with your fingers.

      "1/4 cup fresh orange juice",
      "3 tablespoons granulated sugar",
      "3 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar",
      "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
      "3/4 teaspoon fish sauce",
      "1 (14-ounce) package frozen puff pastry (such as Dufour Pastry Kitchens), thawed",
      "Fresh dill, chopped toasted hazelnuts, and crumbled feta cheese, for garnish"
    ],
    "instructions": "Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss together carrots, oil, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper on a large rimmed baking sheet until evenly coated. Arrange carrots in a single layer, cut sides down, and roast until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Set aside. Leave oven on.\nMeanwhile, finely grate ginger using a Microplane. Place grated ginger in a fine wire-mesh strainer placed over a small bowl. Stir and press ginger to extract about 2 tablespoons of juice. Discard solids.\nWhisk together ginger juice, orange juice, sugar, vinegar, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a 12-inch stainless steel skillet. Cook over medium-low, swirling occasionally, until mixture is reduced to a thick syrup that just coats the bottom of the skillet, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in butter and fish sauce. Set aside.\nRoll out puff pastry on a lightly floured surface into a 14- x 12-inch rectangle. Cut out a 12-inch circle using a pot lid or plate as a guide; discard scraps. Transfer pastry round to a parchment paper–lined baking sheet. Score dough all over with 1/2-inch-long slits. Cover with a second sheet of parchment paper; chill in the refrigerator until ready to use.\nArrange carrots, cut sides down and tightly packed together in an even layer, in the juice mixture in the skillet. Place chilled pastry round over carrots; fold edges inward, as needed, to fit inside the skillet.\nBake tarte Tatin at 425°F until pastry is puffed and golden, about 20 minutes. With tarte Tatin still in oven, reduce oven temperature to 375°F; bake until pastry is deeply browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Let tarte Tatin cool in skillet 5 minutes. Loosen pastry edges from skillet using an offset spatula, if needed. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet, and carefully invert tarte Tatin. Let cool until no longer steaming, about 15 minutes.\nTransfer tarte Tatin to a serving plate or cutting board. Garnish with dill, hazelnuts, and feta. Slice and serve warm or at room temperature.

Remove any debris and strain the excess water.\nStovetop Method\nDrained raw masoor dal and remove scum from cooking red lentils.\nIn a medium pot, add dal along with 3 1/4 cups (~769 ml) of water. Bring this to a boil over medium-high/high heat. Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low-medium so that it simmers. Use a slotted spoon to remove any white scum that rises to the top of the pan. Cover with the lid ajar. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes (See Note 1), until the dal has no bite to it and can easily be mashed. Top with 1/4 cup water if you feel the dal is getting too thick. Turn off the heat.\nInstant Pot Method\nPressure cook red lentils in Instant Pot.\nAdd lentils along with 1 1/2 cups (355 ml) of water. Select Pressure Cook - Low setting and set the timer to 7 minutes (See Note 1). Manually release the pressure.\nFor the Tarka (or Tempering)\nFry cumin seeds in oil. Then brown onions. Add tomatoes, green chili and spices and cook.\nIn a separate large pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the cumin seeds and sauté for about 15 seconds. Add the onions and sauté until slightly golden, about 7 minutes (See Note 2). Add the garlic and ginger and continue to sauté until the raw smell disappears (~30 seconds). Add the tomatoes, green chili pepper, and spice powders (cumin, coriander, red chili, turmeric) and salt. Cook until soft and you see the oil leaving the sides, about 3 minutes.\nAd cooked red lentils to tarka.\nStir the cooked dal into the tarka. Add 1 cup water (more or less), depending on how thick the dal got while cooking and how runny you like the consistency. Mix to combine.\nSimmer dal.\nBring the dal to a simmer. Allow the dal to reduce and the flavors to meld for about 5 minutes, or until you achieve the desired consistency. Taste and adjust salt, if needed.\nTop with finishing ingredients.\nAdd in the ghee or butter. If using fenugreek leaves, crush them between your hands and sprinkle into the dal. Turn off the heat.

      "75ml buttermilk",
      "1 medium egg beaten"
    ],
    "instructions": "Start by getting your biggest flameproof casserole dish and sealing the pork chunks in the oil – they don’t have to be very well browned. Do in batches, then transfer to a plate and tip three-quarters of the onions, the celery, bay and oregano into the dish. Add a splash more oil, if you need, and fry gently until softened.\nTip in the spices, stir for 1 min to toast, then return the pork to the dish. Crumble in the stock cube and stir in the tomatoes, cocoa, sugar, 2 tbsp of the vinegar, the zest and juice from 1 orange, and 3 of the chilli halves. Bring to a simmer, then cover and leave to bubble for 1 hr.\nMeanwhile, finely chop the reserved chilli half and mix with the remaining onions, the spring onions, and red wine vinegar and the zest and juice from the last orange. Keep cold in the fridge.\nAfter 1 hr, stir the sweet potatoes and red peppers into the stew, then re-cover and simmer for another 30 mins.\nWhen the stew has about 15 mins to go, make the dumplings. Rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine crumbs, then stir in the cornmeal, bicarb and sweetcorn. Finally, mix in the buttermilk and all but 1 tbsp of the egg to make a soft dough. Season with some salt and roll the mixture into 12 soft dumplings, then roll in a little more cornmeal to coat the tops. Brush the tops with the reserved beaten egg.\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Stir the beans into the stew, then taste for seasoning. Sit 6 of the dumplings on top of the stew and the rest on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Put both in the oven – the stew without its lid – and cook for 25 mins until the dumplings are golden and risen.\nCarry the stew straight to the table, and sprinkle over a little more oregano before spooning into bowls. Serve the extra dumplings alongside for those who fancy another one, and the onion relish.",

Boil for 8 minutes, drain and plunge into a bowl of cold water. Set aside until cooled, then peel. Trim the white from each end of the eggs so the yolk is just visible at each end. (This means that everyone will get a whole slice of egg in their piece of pie; the trimmed egg whites can be reserved for use in a salad or sandwiches.)\nMix the sausage meat, thyme and lemon zest together in a large bowl and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover and set aside until needed.\nFor the hot-water crust pastry, sift the flour into a bowl.\nPour 100ml/3½fl oz of water into a saucepan, add the lard and salt, and bring to the boil, boiling until the lard has melted.\nGradually pour the boiling water and lard mixture over the flour, mixing well with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together as a dough. Knead the dough in the bowl until smooth and pliant.\nCut off one-third of the dough, wrap it in cling film and set aside to use for the pie lid.\nTurn out the remaining dough onto a lightly floured work surface and roll into a thin rectangle large enough to line the whole of the inside of the tin and reach over the edges slightly.\nLine the tin with the pastry, pushing it into the base and corners and leaving a little hanging over the edges.\nUsing slightly wet hands, press one-third (about 150g/5oz) of the sausage meat mixture into the bottom of the pastry-lined tin. Put half of the dried pickled walnuts on top, then arrange half of the chicken strips down the sides and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nSpread a thin layer (about 75g/3oz) of the remaining sausage meat mixture on top of the chicken and walnuts, then arrange the eggs, end to end, in a line down the middle of the tin, pushing them slightly into the sausage meat mixture. Cover the eggs with another 75g/3oz portion of the sausage meat mixture. Arrange the ham strips on top, across the length of the tin.\nCover the ham with another 75g/3oz layer of sausage meat, then sprinkle the remaining pickled walnuts on top. Arrange the remaining chicken strips on top, then cover with the remaining sausage meat mixture, pressing it down firmly to ensure the pie does not crumble when cut.\nRoll out the reserved one-third of pastry onto a lightly floured work surface.\nBrush some of the beaten egg over the overhanging pastry lining the tin. Cover the pie with the pastry lid, pressing to seal to the overhanging pastry. Trim and crimp the edges of the pastry. Make a small hole in the middle of the pastry lid to allow steam to escape.\nRoll out any pastry trimmings and cut them into shapes to decorate the top of the pie, sticking them to the lid with a little beaten egg. Brush the top of the pie all over with the remaining beaten egg.\nTransfer the pie to a baking tray, then bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until light golde-brown. Reduce the oven temperature to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and continue to bake for 1 hour, or until the pastry is deep golden-brown on top and the filling is cooked through.\nAllow the pie to cool completely in the tin, then lift out of the tin using the baking paper lining. Peel away the baking paper and chill the pie in the fridge overnight.\nTo serve, cut the pie into thick slices and serve cold.",

      "6 cloves of garlic - chopped",
      "1 large onion - chopped",
      "1 large carrot – chopped",
      "2 tbsp vegetable oil",
      "600-800 ml chicken stock (or vegetable stock for vegan variation)",
      "1 tbsp curry powder (your choice of strength. I use medium)",
      "1 tbsp dark soy sauce (or more if needed)",
      "1-2 tsps of honey (or sugar/maple syrup for vegans. Add more if needed)",
      "3 tbsp of flour"
    ],
    "instructions": "Fry the onions in the vegetable oil until soft - around eight minutes, then add the garlic. Stir for a minute or two. Then add the carrots and cook for a few more minutes.\nAdd the curry powder and stir well. After cooking through for a few minutes, add the flour a little at a time and continue to combine.\nAdd the chicken stock a little at a time, whisking well and making sure all the flour is combined and there are no lumps.\nSimmer for 10-15 minutes stirring occasionally and let the sauce thicken.\nUsing a stick blender, blitz the ingredients into a smooth sauce. If you don't have a stick blender, you can use a food processor or blender.\nKeep stirring the sauce on a low heat and continue to simmer.\nAdd the soy sauce to season as well as the honey or sugar. You could add salt, but I personally don’t think it needs it as the soy is already salty.\nYou can add more water if the sauce becomes too thick.\nServe with panko breaded chicken, salmon or pork - or aubergine, tofu and sweet potatoes over rice or noodles. Enjoy.",

Pour in the olive oil and add the garlic, then add all the remaining ingredients.\nSquish everything about together, then seal the bag, place it on a plate or in a dish, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or up to 1 day.\nWhen you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Remove the chicken from the fridge and allow it to reach room temperature.\nTip the contents of the freezer bag into a shallow roasting tin – mine measures 44x34x1.5cm/17x13x½in – and make sure all the chicken thighs are lying flat and not on top of one another (if possible) before roasting in the hot oven for 30 minutes, by which time they should be cooked through (though obviously you must check) and golden on top.\nWhen the chicken’s more or less cooked, make the sauce simply by combining the yoghurt with the tahini and garlic, stir and salt to taste, and sprinkle with a few pomegranate seeds.\nLine a platter or a couple of plates with crisp lettuce, shredded or torn into pieces, and then top with the piping hot chicken, pouring the oily juices over them, unless you are, for some inexplicable reason, anti-oily-juices. If you wanted to make the chicken go further, you could cut the thighs into chunky slices rather than leaving them whole. And please do add any of the suggested accompaniments, itemized in my introduction.",

    "instructions": "For the Keralan curry, put the turmeric, yoghurt and a pinch of salt in a bowl and mix well. Add the chicken pieces and leave to marinate for an hour.\nMeanwhile, make the curry paste. Place a frying pan over a low heat and add the oil, followed by the ginger and garlic. Fry for about a minute, then add the remaining paste ingredients and fry for 5–6 minutes, or until lightly coloured. Leave to cool, then transfer to a blender, add 3–5 tablespoons water and blend to a fine paste. Set aside.\nTo finish the Keralan chicken curry, place a heavy-based, non-stick pan over a medium heat and add the vegetable oil. When hot, add the chillies and let them sizzle for about 10 seconds. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and fry for 10–12 minutes, or until browned.\nStir in the blended tomatoes and cook for 3 minutes. Add the spice paste and fry for 4–5 minutes, stirring well, until the sauce thickens slightly.\nIncrease the heat and add the marinated chicken pieces, stirring well to coat them with spice paste. Fry for 4 minutes, or until lightly coloured. Add 100ml/3½fl oz water and season with salt and pepper.\nCover with a lid and simmer for 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Add the coconut milk, stir well and simmer for a further 4–7 minutes, or until the sauce is slightly thickened.\nFor the raita, in a small bowl, add the mint, coriander, yoghurt, ginger, spring onions and 100ml water to a blender. Blend to a smooth paste, then transfer to a bowl and sprinkle over the crushed cumin seeds, black salt and sea salt. Set aside.\nFor the lime and coriander rice, season the cooked rice with salt and pepper. Fork lightly to loosen the grains and set aside.\nPlace a large heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat and add the oil. When hot, add the chopped chilli and fry for a few seconds. Add the rice and heat through, stirring well. Add the lime zest and fresh coriander. Mix well and turn off the heat. Stir through the lime juice.\nTo serve, garnish the curry with chilli flakes or coriander and serve in bowls with the rice and raita alongside.",

      "½ tsp salt",
      "100g/3½oz lard, plus extra for greasing",
      "1 free-range egg yolk, beaten"
    ],
    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Grease a 1kg/2lb 4oz loaf tin (measuring about 10x20cm/4x8in across the base) with lard, then cut one long strip of baking parchment, the width of the tin, and place it in the tin so that there’s an overhang of parchment at each end, which will help you remove the pie later.\nFirst make the filling. Put all the ingredients, except the hard-boiled eggs, into a large bowl and season lightly with salt and white pepper. Mix together thoroughly using your hands. Cook a little nugget of the mixture in a frying pan and taste it to check the seasoning. Add more seasoning, as necessary, to the remaining filling. Put the mixture in the fridge while you make the pastry.\nTo make the pastry, combine the flours in a bowl, add the butter and rub in lightly with your fingertips. Heat 200ml/7fl oz water, the salt and lard in a saucepan until just boiling. Pour the mixture onto the flour and mix together with a spoon. Once cool enough to handle, tip onto a floured surface and knead into a smooth dough.\nWorking as quickly as you can (the pastry will become more crumbly as it cools), roll out two-thirds of the pastry and use it to line the prepared tin, leaving any excess hanging over the edges.\nPress half of the meat filling into the pastry-lined tin. Take a thin slice off the top and bottom of each boiled egg (this helps them sit next to each other and makes slicing the pie easier), then place the eggs lengthways down the middle of the pie. Add the remaining meat filling and pat it down.\nBrush the overhanging pastry edge with egg yolk. Roll out the remaining pastry to make a lid and place over the pie. Pinch the pastry edges together to seal and trim the edges neatly. Make three steam holes in the top of the pie and brush with more egg yolk.\nBake for 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and bake for a further hour. Leave to cool completely in the tin.\nTo remove the pie, turn the tin on its side and use the parchment paper to slide out the pie. Serve in thick slices.",

      "2 tsp gochujang paste, or other hot sauce, to taste",

      "2 tbsp regular olive oil",
      "8 soft corn tortillas",
      "2 ripe avocados",
      "1 lime, juice only, plus 2 limes, cut into wedges",
      "salad leaves of your choice",
      "1–2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander"
    ],
    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 for the fish, and begin by preparing the sides for your tacos. Put the red onion slices into a bowl and cover with the lime juice. Stir with a fork to mix the onion well in the juice. Actually, if you can get this done ahead of time (up to 1 day), so much the better, but even 20 minutes is fine.\nMake the hot sauce by mixing together the mayonnaise and the gochujang paste (or other hot sauce) in a small bowl. Set aside.\nFor the corn relish, put the canned sweetcorn into a bowl. Add the chilli to the sweetcorn, along with the chopped coriander and some salt to taste. Give it all a good stir, and set aside.\nCut the fish fillets in half lengthways, so you have long fingers, and arrange in a shallow roasting tin. Mix together the cumin, paprika and salt, and sprinkle over the fish fillets. Mix the garlic and the oil in a small bowl. Drizzle the fish with the garlicky oil, and roast in the oven for 8–10 minutes, depending on the thickness of your fillets. Check to see if the fish is cooked through (though only just) before taking out of the oven.\nOnce you’ve taken the fish out (though don’t let it get cold) turn off the oven and warm the tortillas in the fading heat. Meanwhile, peel, stone and slice the avocados, then spritz with the juice of a lime, ready to serve with the other accompaniments.\nArrange the fish on a plate (lined with salad leaves, if so desired), sprinkle with some chopped fresh coriander, and take to the table along with the warmed tortillas. If you don’t want to add any salad to the fish directly, you may want to put a bowl of shredded iceberg or some other crisp leaves nearby.\nPut the bowls of soused, but drained, red onions, the corn relish, hot sauce and a plate of sliced avocados on the table so that everyone can load their tortillas. A plate of lime wedges and a pile of napkins are both good ideas, too.",

      "250g dried black bean soaked overnight, then drained",
      "100g streaky smoked bacon cut into slices",
      "500g pork rib",
      "3 chorizo cooking sausages",
      "500g pork shoulder, cut into 5cm cubes",

    ],
    "instructions": "Heat a large heavy-based saucepan with a fitted lid, add the bacon and fry until crisp. Remove and keep the oil in the pan. In batches sear the ribs, sausages and pork shoulder. Season each batch with salt and pepper.\nRemove the meat and set aside. Add the onion, garlic and chilli to the pan. Pour in a little olive oil if it needs more. Season with salt and pepper and fry for 8 mins or until soft.\nAdd the meat, bay leaves, white wine vinegar and drained beans. Cover with just enough water to cover, about 650ml. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover and cook for 2 hrs, or until the beans are soft and the meat is tender. If there is too much liquid in the pot take the lid off in the last hr. You can also use a slow cooker on the short method (4 hr) or make a quick version using a pressure cooker in batches for 30 mins each. Another method is to cook it in the oven for 3-4 hrs at 160C/140C fan/gas 3.\nServe with rice, a sprinkle of parsley or coriander, hot pepper sauce and orange slices.",

    "instructions": "For the pastry, pulse the flour, baking powder, salt, butter and egg yolk in a food processor until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the grated parmesan and stir until well combined.\nGradually add the water, a tablespoon at a time, mixing continuously until the mixture just comes together as a dough. (You may not need to use all of the water.) Roll the dough into a ball, then wrap it in cling film and chill in the fridge for an hour.\nMeanwhile, for the filling, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the potato pieces to the pan and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until tender, then drain well and set aside.\nBring a separate large saucepan of water to the boil, add the sliced onions and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Drain well and return the cooked onions to the saucepan.\nSprinkle the onions with the flour and stir well to coat. Add the milk and cream and heat the mixture over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring continuously, until the liquid is smooth and has thickened slightly. Add the cooked potato pieces, grated cheese, mustard and cayenne pepper and stir well. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper, stir well, then set the filling mixture aside.\nPreheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease a deep 20cm/8in pie tin with butter. Add a small amount of flour, turn the tin to coat the base and sides of the tin, then shake out any excess.\nWhen the pastry has chilled, roll out two thirds of it onto a clean, floured work surface, until it is almost twice as wide as the diameter of the pie tin. Using the rolling pin, lift the pastry and lay it over the pie tin to line the base and sides. Gently press the pastry into the corners of the tin, trimming off any excess, then prick the base of the pastry case several times with a fork.\nCover the pastry with a sheet of greaseproof paper and fill it with rice or dried beans. Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the pastry is pale golden-brown. Remove from the oven, discard the beans and greaseproof paper and set the pastry aside to cool. When cool, pour the pie filling into the pastry case.\nRoll the remaining one third of the pastry out onto a clean, floured work surface until it is slightly larger than the diameter of the pie tin. Brush the rim of the cooked pastry case with some of the beaten egg and place the pastry lid on top of the pie. Trim off any excess pastry. Seal the pastry lid to the pastry case by crimping the edges of the pastry lid with a fork.\nWith a knife, make two small holes in the centre of the pastry lid to allow steam to escape. Brush the pastry lid with the remaining beaten egg, then transfer to the oven and bake for 25-30 mins, or until golden-brown.",

      "140g radish",
      "140g pea",
      "25g butter diced",
      "few pinches of sugar"

    "instructions": "Toss the rabbit joints (or diced meat) with half the flour and some seasoning. Heat half the oil in a flameproof casserole dish and brown the meat on all sides. Lift out the meat, add the remaining oil, the leek and fennel seeds, and fry gently until softened. Stir in the remaining flour until it has disappeared. Add the cider and scrape up any stuck bits on the dish as it comes to the boil, then add the stock, return the meat to the dish, and bring to a simmer.\nCover and cook for 40-45 mins until the rabbit is really tender and falling from the bone. Lift out the meat and, while you’re shredding it from the bones in big chunks (if you’ve used joints), boil down the cooking liquid to about a third.\nStir the cream and mustard into the liquid, taste for seasoning, then stir the rabbit back in. Spoon into a small pie dish or baking dish.\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Stick a thin strip of pastry around the edge of the dish. Slice the remaining pastry into 2.5cm-wide strips with a floured knife, then weave into a tight lattice. Lift up carefully, using a rolling pin to help you, then stick on with a little beaten egg. Trim the edges to finish. Brush the top with more egg and bake for 25 mins until golden.\nMeanwhile, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the carrots for 2 mins, then the radishes for 2 mins, followed by the peas for 1 min. Drain. When the pie is done, melt the butter in a small frying pan. Add the drained veg with the sugar, turn up the heat and fry to caramelise a little. Serve immediately alongside the pie.",

    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Grease the base and sides of a 900g/2lb loaf tin with lard and line with baking parchment.\nFor the filling, place the eggs into a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Boil for 8 minutes, drain and plunge into a bowl of cold water. Set aside until cooled, then peel. Trim the white from each end of the eggs so the yolk is just visible at each end. (This means that everyone will get a whole slice of egg in their piece of pie; the trimmed egg whites can be reserved for use in a salad or sandwiches.)\nMix the sausage meat, thyme and lemon zest together in a large bowl and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover and set aside until needed.\nFor the hot-water crust pastry, sift the flour into a bowl.\nPour 100ml/3½fl oz of water into a saucepan, add the lard and salt, and bring to the boil, boiling until the lard has melted.\nGradually pour the boiling water and lard mixture over the flour, mixing well with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together as a dough. Knead the dough in the bowl until smooth and pliant.\nCut off one-third of the dough, wrap it in cling film and set aside to use for the pie lid.\nTurn out the remaining dough onto a lightly floured work surface and roll into a thin rectangle large enough to line the whole of the inside of the tin and reach over the edges slightly.\nLine the tin with the pastry, pushing it into the base and corners and leaving a little hanging over the edges.\nUsing slightly wet hands, press one-third (about 150g/5oz) of the sausage meat mixture into the bottom of the pastry-lined tin. Put half of the dried pickled walnuts on top, then arrange half of the chicken strips down the sides and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nSpread a thin layer (about 75g/3oz) of the remaining sausage meat mixture on top of the chicken and walnuts, then arrange the eggs, end to end, in a line down the middle of the tin, pushing them slightly into the sausage meat mixture. Cover the eggs with another 75g/3oz portion of the sausage meat mixture. Arrange the ham strips on top, across the length of the tin.\nCover the ham with another 75g/3oz layer of sausage meat, then sprinkle the remaining pickled walnuts on top. Arrange the remaining chicken strips on top, then cover with the remaining sausage meat mixture, pressing it down firmly to ensure the pie does not crumble when cut.\nRoll out the reserved one-third of pastry onto a lightly floured work surface.\nBrush some of the beaten egg over the overhanging pastry lining the tin. Cover the pie with the pastry lid, pressing to seal to the overhanging pastry. Trim and crimp the edges of the pastry. Make a small hole in the middle of the pastry lid to allow steam to escape.\nRoll out any pastry trimmings and cut them into shapes to decorate the top of the pie, sticking them to the lid with a little beaten egg. Brush the top of the pie all over with the remaining beaten egg.\nTransfer the pie to a baking tray, then bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until light golde-brown. Reduce the oven temperature to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and continue to bake for 1 hour, or until the pastry is deep golden-brown on top and the filling is cooked through.\nAllow the pie to cool completely in the tin, then lift out of the tin using the baking paper lining. Peel away the baking paper and chill the pie in the fridge overnight.\nTo serve, cut the pie into thick slices and serve cold.",

Brown the oxtail over a medium heat for about 10 minutes, turning every now and then, until dark brown all over. You may need to add extra oil if the pan looks dry at any point during the browning step. Put the browned oxtail into a flameproof casserole dish.

Cover with a lid and cook in the centre of the oven for 3 hours. Stir after 1½ hours, turning the oxtail in the sauce.\nAfter 3 hours, the meat should be falling off the bone and the sauce should be thick.

    "yields": "4 servings",
    "ingredients": [
      "85g/3oz caster sugar",
      "70g/2½oz flaky sea salt",
      "2 tbsp schnapps, gin or vodka",
      "2 tsp freshly ground white pepper",
      "100g/3½oz fresh dill",
      "500g/1lb 2oz centre-cut salmon fillet, skin on, bones removed",
      "1 large cucumber, peeled, thinly sliced",
      "1 tsp sea salt",
      "2 tsp caster sugar",
      "freshly ground white pepper",
      "1-2 tbsp white wine vinegar",
      "3 tbsp Dijon mustard",
      "squeeze lemon juice",
      "2 tsp caster sugar",
      "1-2 tsp dried dill",
      "salt and pepper",
      "2-3 tbsp sunflower oil"
    ],
    "instructions": "To cure the salmon, blend together the sugar, salt, alcohol, white pepper and dill in a food processor to make a paste.\nPlace half of the mixture into a container that will accommodate the fish snugly (say the plastic container the fish was bought in). Lay the salmon on top of this flesh-side down, press it down, then cover with the other half of the mixture, smearing it well over the surface of the fish. Secure with a lid or cling film and leave to chill in the fridge for 48 hours, turning the fish occasionally, until firm to the touch.\nFor the cucumber salad, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and leave to macerate for an hour in the fridge. Drain off the liquid, put the cucumber into a serving dish and chill in the fridge. The salad should be served really cold.\nFor the sauce, mix the mustard, lemon juice, sugar, salt, pepper and dried dill in a bowl until well combined. Gradually whisk in the oil until you have a loose, thick dressing. You may need a little more oil. Pour into a small serving bowl.\nCarefully rinse the fish under cold running water, but not so much that no remnants of dill remain. Dry with kitchen paper.\nThinly slice the gravad lax at an angle and present on a large serving dish. Serve alongside the cucumber salad and the mustard sauce with buttered rye bread.",
